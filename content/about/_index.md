Hi! My name is Mike Skolnik and I like coding, cooking, memory techniques, and spending time with my girlfriend and our 2 dogs, not necessarily in that order.

This site will have posts about several different things I find interesting. I love to smoke meats, so there will be smoking meat posts. There will be coding tips and learnings from my years of experience. Speaking of learning, I have several methods I've used including spaced repetition with Anki and memory palaces. I'll have posts about them as well as relevant links to everything I discuss.

I hope you like what you find!
