[Magnetic Memory Method](https://www.magneticmemorymethod.com/ "Magnetic Memory Method") - This got me started on my memory journey. It isn't cheap but I highly recommend if you're mainly interested in learning.

[The Ron Paul Home School Curriculum](https://www.ronpaulcurriculum.com "The Ron Paul Home School Curriculum") - In my opinion the best home school curriculum available. Check it out!

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/ "Anki") - Anki spaced repitition software. It's free and there tons of shard decks you can use but I find it more beneficial to create my own.

[Smoking Meat Forums](https://www.smokingmeatforums.com/ "Smoking Meat Forums") - A fantastic site for beginners and experts alike in learning more about smoking and grilling.
