Hi! My name is Mike Skolnik and I like cooking, coding, and spending time with my dog <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/0ho0l2WoJkuVHLKp2" target="_blank">Luna</a>.

I am a data scientist with SQL, Python, R, Tableau, and Power BI skills who loves working with data and finding patterns in data. I also like experimenting with new tools to see if they would be beneficial to do any data analysis or visualizations. I love learning new things and then applying that new knowledge to my work as well.

I've taken several online courses on web development, web design, data analysis, and data science at Udemy, DataCamp, and more. You can see my completed DataCamp coursework at my <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/profile/michaelskolnik" target="_blank">profile</a>.
