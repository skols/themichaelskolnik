To do that I wanted to create one text file that could be imported into something else. In this case it required a little more work because the files had dates and times in their names but the date wasn't in the data. I wanted to keep the date though, so I added a field for each file that contained the date and time part of the filename. I thought Python would be good for everything I wanted to do and it was.
