    "This is my R code for the first two sections of the level 2 part of the *Learn Machine Learning* series on Kaggle. I've already done the Python one, which is on Kaggle located [here](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning). The data used is from the [*Home Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "I had planned on doing all of level 2 but that was more difficult than I expected. One reason for that is the Python series told me what packages to use and gave me an outline of steps to follow. Since I'm doing this in R with no tutorial to follow, I had to research and decide which packages to use and steps to follow. That slowed me down but I definitely learned a lot. I also had problems with Jupyter and the R kernel, so I worked on this in RStudio while fixing those issues."
